    <h1>How Aerodynamics, DRS and ERS changed Formula one</h1>
    <div id="abstract"></div>
    <strong>Abstract:</strong>
    <p>F1 has developed exponentially since the first Grand Prix and so have the cars. F1 has now shifted from large engines with little safety, heavy steering and lack of aerodynamics to carefully manufactured wings, advanced energy systems and new innovations. Early aerodynamics were pioneered by Colin Chapman of Team Lotus in the 1960s with the 49B by using an inverted wing to generate downforce. Since the sport is highly reliant on the newest technological advancements in aerodynamics and electrical systems, the sport has changed for not only the drivers but also the entertainment industry itself. As a result, new strategies and systems with hybrid-technology have emerged from the annual regulations. While this may be seen as positive, for many viewers this has impacted the purity and excitement for the sport, due to new systems which require ‘less skill’ to use. For example, the DRS is seen as an easy overtake which creates a disadvantage for the leading car. However, the ERS is praised for providing a new layer to racing with energy management and derating which boosts competitiveness and more calculated attacks and defences.</p>
    <div id="introduction"></div>
    <strong>Introduction:</strong>
    <p>“Aerodynamics are for people who can’t build engines” – Enzo Ferrari<br>Enzo Ferrari is one of the greatest entrepreneurs ever however his quote couldn’t falser. Aerodynamics plays a vital role in f1 cars today. Without it, cars would not be able to corner at high speeds, accelerate without taking off the ground and provide competitive racing. The FIA (Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile) controls regulations in F1 and encourage the use of aerodynamics and hybrid technology as it allows for closer racing and overtaking, providing a more entertaining race. Furthermore, the use of aerodynamics combined with new electrical systems in F1 cars allow for higher speeds on straights and more strategic ways of racing including DRS (Drag Reduction System) and ERS (Energy Recovery System) which are essential for overtaking in races. However the use of the hybrid engines is extremely expensive and a shift from the large V10 engines used in the previous years, which viewers enjoyed.</p>
    <div id="pre-aero"></div>
    <strong>The pre-aerodynamics era:</strong>
    <p>The first formula one race took place on May 13th, 1950, at the Silverstone Circuit in the United Kingdom. Competitors such as Ferrari, Alfa Romeo and Maserati took part with large and heavy engines for maximum speed and power. The cars that took part had a low power-to-weight ratio, simple engineering, heavy steering and zero use of aerodynamics. The lack of aerodynamics lead to limited downforce and poor cornering speed focusing on straight lines to gain speed (the opposite of what formula one is known for today).</p>
    <div id="aero"></div>
    <strong>Aerodynamics is introduced: Wings & ground effect</strong>
    <p>In the late 1960s, Team Lotus introduced innovative designs that incorporated aerodynamics by adding wings to the car by inverting the aerofoil of an airplane wing on the Lotus 49B. While wings on an aeroplane generate lift to fly, the aerofoil does the opposite and generates downforce to grip the road. This was the beginning of the scientific approach to formula one which is still used to this day, in contrast to the previous decade of raw speed and power using large engines. The man behind the development was Colin Chapman a design engineer and inventor who discovered ground effect aerodynamics. The first use of venturi tunnels was on the Lotus 78 in 1977. While the 78 did achieve 7 grand prix wins and 9 pole positions, the car experienced a severe number of problems with the chassis, as the stress generated by the downforce caused the suspension to become unstable, therefore, retired from many races. While the car did not perform extremely well nor win a championship, it was the pioneer that set off the generation of new innovative ways of producing the cars in f1. However, the following season was won by team Lotus and the driver Mario Andretti in the Lotus 79.</p>

<div id="modern"></div>
<strong>The modern era: turbo-hybrid era</strong>
<p>The current era of f1 cars is extremely dependent on aerodynamics and even use smaller turbo-charged engines as well as new hybrid systems that use electric motor-generators that provide even more power to the wheels. The DRS, also known as drag reduction system, has the driver open a flap on the rear wing to increase the straight-line speed and reduce the drag. This new technology allows for closer racing 
</p>

<div id="drs-ers"></div>
<strong>The DRS system:</strong>
<p>
The Drag Reduction System (DRS) was first introduced in 2011 to encourage and increase overtaking opportunities, Providing more wheel-to-wheel scenarios for more engaging and exciting races. Overtaking before DRS was much harder due to the turbulent air (dirty air) produced by cars in front as the aerodynamic components create low-pressure and ‘chaotic air’ which reduces downforce, speed and handling for cars behind. The DRS prevents turbulent air by opening the flap on the rear wing when the driver presses a button in a specific part of the track. When the wing is closed, air resistance is greater and therefore the car generates downforce and drag. When the rear wing opens, the air resistance acting on the car decreases due to a lower angle of attack of the wing, causing drag and downforce to decrease. This increases the speed of the car by approximately 6-7.5 mph. However, the DRS is only used on straights for safety and can only be activated when within one second of the car in front.

<div id="ers"></div>
<strong>The ERS system:</strong>
<p>The Energy Recovery System (ERS) was first introduced in 2014 and is an evolution from Kinetic Energy Recovery System (KERS) (first used in 2009). ERS has two systems which use waste energy from the exhaust and brakes to charge a battery. This battery allows for a power boost. The Motor Generator Unit – Kinetic (MGU-K) is a motor and generator. It takes the rotation of the wheels and through the process of electromagnetic induction, contains rotating magnets that induces a current. This electricity is then stored in a battery and can be used later to gain an advantage. With the push of a button, the MGU-K becomes a generator by releasing the energy from the battery to turn the crankshaft which then allows for greater rotation of the wheels generating up to 160 horsepower. The Motor Generator Unit – Heat (MGU-H) works as both as a motor and generator and uses the heat from the exhaust gases produced by the turbocharger. The MGU-H can convert this energy to electricity then transferred to the battery or the MGU-K. It also combats turbo lag as it spools up the turbocharger. The electrical power allows the turbocharger’s turbine to spin up to speed much faster than the gases from the turbocharger would.

<div id="discussion"></div>
<strong>Discussion:</strong>
<p>The DRS has a mixed opinion by viewers as it is seen as an easy speed boost and doesn’t require skill to overtake, reducing the ‘purity’ of the sport. In addition, the leading car is seen to have a disadvantage and an unequal opportunity to keep their position with an increased risk of accidents due to attempted overtakes. However, while the overtakes may be viewed as artificial, there is no doubt more overtakes is far more exciting than none. Furthermore, when DRS is active, turbulent air is no longer a problem which allows the cars to reduce the gap between leading cars for more competitive racing.
ERS compared to DRS is mainly well received as it can provide strategic depth to races as drivers can decide when and how to use the system which is known as derate (using the system later to allow battery to charge). The system also provides excitement and plays a crucial role in overtaking in the last moments of races in wheel-to-wheel situations as strategic energy management is needed. However, when DRS and ERS are synergised the skill and tactical component of driving becomes a necessity to produce a manoeuvre.
</p>

<div id="conclusion"></div>
<strong>Conclusion:</strong>
<p>Overall, the DRS and ERS has changed F1 significantly by providing more strategic components to racing by adding new systems, developing greater depth to driving skill. Overtaking is now more common (whether artificial or not) providing greater entertainment and excitement with new speed, attacks and defences. Energy management has changed the way drivers will race as the synergy between DRS and ERS can encourage more aggressive driving alongside derating for a greater advantage. Formula One has undergone changes over the years through regulations, new technology and innovation which has overall provided far more benefits than drawbacks despite the controversy over these systems and will continue to find new complex ways to make racing more competitive, aggressive and entertaining.
