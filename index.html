<h1> Effects of DRS in Formula One </h1> 

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
“Aerodynamics are for people who can’t build engines” – Enzo Ferrari
Aerodynamics plays a vital role in f1 cars today. Without it, cars would not be able to corner at high speeds, accelerate without taking off the ground and provide competitive racing. The FIA (Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile) controls regulations in F1 and encourage the use of aerodynamics as it allows for closer racing and overtaking, Such as the Drag Reduction System which provides a more entertaining race. This paper will investigate the effects of DRS, how it works and the impact it has had on formula one viewers.


<h2 id="drs-mechanism">DRS Mechanism</h2>
F1 cars need to generate downforce to corner at high speeds of up to 190 miles per hour. Downforce is the absolute fundamental of cornering at those speeds. “Downforce is a vertical aerodynamic force that pushes down on the car, to generate more grip and go faster through corners,” (Emel Cankaya - Why F1 cars have wings – with a McLaren Aero Specialist). This wing is not the same shape as a normal wing on a plane which is used to generate lift but an upside-down wing and provides the opposite force of lift – downforce. This phenomenon occurs due to Bernoulli’s Principle which states when velocity of a fluid is high, pressure is low. An F1 wing is in the shape of an aerofoil and can create a difference in pressure. ‘When air travels around the upper surface of the inverted aerofoil, the velocity of the air slows down as the air must move around the wing while on the lower surface velocity is greater, forming areas of high pressure and low pressure. Due to the difference in pressure between the upper and lower surfaces downforce is generated’ (NASA (2010). Bernoulli’s principle). However, while downforce is essential to corner at high speeds, this also produces a large amount of drag. The DRS reduces this drag and allows for more opportunities in overtaking on specific parts of the track where there are straights.

Turbulent air is a result of the low pressure generated from the rear wing and the effects the car has on the air which causes disruption, this makes it difficult for drivers behind the leading car to overtake as the airflow is not flowing as expected. ‘When DRS is activated by the press of a button, the rear flap on the wing opens’ (Aston Martin F1 Team). When this occurs, air can pass through the wing and reduces the overall drag on the car as well as turbulent air (dirty air). This is particularly beneficial to the cars behind as turbulent air no longer causes a loss in speed. The DRS is only used in areas on a track where the is a long straight. This is because DRS reduces the downforce and would be dangerous to use around corners and chicanes leading to loss of traction. as opportunities arise for an overtake This is a significant part of the new racing strategies in F1 as it allows for a ‘greater increase in speed by 8 – 12 km/h’ (5 – 7.5 mph) (Aston Martin F1 Team). ‘The drag is reduced by roughly 20% while a multi-element rear wing has shown a reduction in 83% when tested in free-flow conditions where no obstructions occur when driving’ (Zhang, Z. (2023). Study on aerodynamic development in Formula One racing.)

<h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
The DRS has a mixed opinion by viewers as it is seen as an easy speed boost and doesn’t require skill to overtake, reducing the ‘purity’ of the sport. In addition, the leading car is seen to have a disadvantage and an unequal opportunity to keep their position with an increased risk of accidents due to attempted overtakes. However, while the overtakes may be viewed as artificial, there is no doubt more overtakes is far more exciting than none. Furthermore, when DRS is active, turbulent air is no longer a problem which allows the cars to reduce the gap between leading cars for more competitive racing. However, the DRS is undergoing change in the 2026 season, DRS being removed and replaced with Z-mode and X-mode. ‘The FIA aim to reduce the amount of drag from the car by cutting the weight of the car by new regulations making the length and width of the car much shorter, the wheelbase being reduced by 200mm and the width cut by 100mm. This will reduce the weight by 30kg now the overall car will be 768kg (722kg car and 46kg tyres). In tandem the rules have cut downforce by 30% and reduced drag by 55% to improve efficiency and handling making the cars more raceable. The front wing will have a two-element flap and the rear wing having three elements. The Z-mode is the standard racing system however both the front wing and rear wing will open allowing for greater downforce and so greater cornering speed. X-mode is a low-drag configuration which angles the flaps of the wing on both the rear and front wing to maximise straight-line speed’ (Formula 1® - The Official F1® Website. (2024). Inside the 2026 aerodynamics regulations). ‘Another new system called the Manual Override Mode (MOM) will work in tandem to the MGU-K. When MOM is active, the amount of electrical power the driver can use will increase’. This potentially allows for more ‘organic’ overtaking (Mitchell-Malm, S. (2024). Why F1’s dropping DRS for its 2026 cars). This implements greater strategic thinking and not a simple overtake with the press of a button such as DRS was viewed as.

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
Overall, DRS is essential for the competitiveness of F1 and provides for greater opportunities for overtaking for followings cars. While the DRS is criticised for its simplicity and lack of strategic use it generates a greater number of overtakes which is better than none. The new Z/X mode is yet to be used however the system plans to develop use alongside the MOM which encourages energy management .
